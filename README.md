# Challenge_10

## In this challenge I created a model that illustrates the movement and performance of cryptocurrencies. The performance is clustered into datasets to be reviewed by potential investors and advisors to find oppourtunities in a volatile market. 

## I essentially cleaned the data by using KMeans reduce the number of columns and rows. I then took this data and then reduced it more by using PCA. I searched for the best "k" and decided that 3 clusters provided a better outcome than 4. After plotting this data (scatter) I produced side by side illustrations so that the results could be compared.
